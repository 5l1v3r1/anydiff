# anydiff

This is an [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation) package based on the [anyvec](https://github.com/unixpickle/anyvec) vector library. It is designed with machine learning in mind, but it can easily extend to things beyond ML.
